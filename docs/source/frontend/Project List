# The ProjectList Component

The `ProjectList` component is located at:

.. code-block:: bash

frontend_react/src/components/ProjectList.js

## Overview

The `ProjectList` component displays a list of projects in the web application. It is responsible for fetching the project data from the backend, allowing for filtering by project status, and rendering the project data in a grid format.

## Key Features

1. **Data Fetching:** Fetches project data from the backend using `axios`.

2. **Role and Token Handling:** Retrieves the user role from the token stored in cookies. It uses this to determine what projects should be displayed based on the role of the user.

3. **Project Filtering:** Allows for filtering the displayed projects by their status (e.g., all, approved, pending, rejected).

4. **Grid Display:** Displays projects in a grid format using the `SimpleGrid` component from `@chakra-ui/react`.

5. **Loading State Handling:** Displays a loading icon while project data is being fetched, transitioning to the actual content once data is ready.
