HomeNew Component
=================

The ``HomeNew`` component is located at::

   frontend_react\src\components\HomeNew.js

This is the main page of the web application, which displays different projects and auctions. This component is built with React.

Key Features
------------

1. **Data Fetching:** Uses the ``axios`` library to fetch different data such as projects, users, and auctions from the backend.

2. **Displaying Auctions and Projects:** Provides functionality to display a list of projects and auctions. Includes a carousel view to rotate through the list.

3. **Navigating to Details:** Contains functions to handle navigation to the detail pages of individual projects and auctions.

4. **Statistics Display:** Displays the total number of users, projects applied, and total SUCoins raised.

5. **Loading State Handling:** Displays a loading icon while data is being fetched, transitioning to the actual content once data is ready.
