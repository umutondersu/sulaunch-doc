Setup Guide
===========

Requirements
------------

-  Pull the latest version of the project Install node.js v18
-  Install pnpm with (npm install -g pnpm)

To Run Frontend:
----------------

In frontend_react
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run: pnpm i

In /src/contracts_hardhat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run:

pnpm add -D hardhat

pnpm hardhat compile

.. _in-frontend_react-1:

In frontend_react
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run: pnpm start

To Run Backend:
---------------

In backend_dotnet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run: dotnet run

To set up metamask
------------------

Create a wallet Go to settings -> networks -> Add a network

Network Name: Mumbai Testnet (Optional)

New RPC URL: https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/4458cf4d1689497b9a38b1d6bbf05e78
Chain ID: 80001 

Currency Symbol: MATIC 

Block Explorer URL (optional): https://mumbai.polygonscan.com

After the network, go to assets -> Import Tokens and enter the current
address of SUCoin.

Press save and use this Metamask settings while entering the website.
This process is automatic for users when they first enter the website.
They just need to agree on the changes.

Docker Setup
------------

Docker Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run:

docker compose build

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

Important:

-d flag is not required if the containers will run on a screen

REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL and REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL need to be set
accordingly inside the docker-compose.yml file

Shutting down the containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run: docker compose down

if it does not work,

run:

docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

For Linux Enviroments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

podman-compose can be used instead of docker compose and podman instead
of docker if root access is not available

To keep the containers running in the background when the terminal is
closed, create a new screen and run the commands inside of it

Screen controls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run: screen -S

Deattach the current screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press CTRL+A and then D

Reattach a screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

run: screen -x

To terminate the current screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press CTRL+A and then K then Y and then Enter

Smart Contract Deployment
-------------------------

When the project will operate on the Polygon Mainnet, Contracts have to
be redeployed with the instructions below:

``Sucoin``, ``Project Register`` and ``BokkyPooBahsRedBlackTreeLibrary``
Contracts need to be deployed manually before all the others and their
address needs to be set in the ``deploy_maestro.js`` file at
frontend_react/src/contracts_hardhat/scripts/deploy_maestro.js

``Sucoin`` is handled by the Supayment team. Please contact them to
learn the address of the contract.

``Project Register`` is in frontend_react/src/contracts_hardhat/contracts

``BokkyPooBahsRedBlackTreeLibrary`` is in the libraries folder of the
same directory.

Deploy them using Remix or any other contract deployment tool. To learn
how to deploy contracts using Remix, please refer
`here <https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/remix/>`__

After these steps, hardhat.config.js file needs to be updated for the
polygon mainnet. the necessary steps can be found
`here <https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/hardhat>`__ at the
``Setting up the contract`` section.

Now the rest of the contracts are ready to be deployed. To deploy them
with hardhat run the following commands in the
frontend_react/src/contracts_hardhat directory:

pnpm hardhat compile

pnpm hardhat run scripts/deploy_maestro.js â€“polygon_mumbai

After the contracts are deployed, their addresses will be printed to the
console. These addresses need to be set in the location of the contract
addresses in the project before booting up.

Locations of Contract Addresses
-------------------------------

Enviorment Variables:

-  REACT_APP_MAESTRO_ADDRESS for Maestro(Auction) Contract
-  REACT_APP_PROJECT_REGISTER_ADDRESS for ProjectRegister Contract
-  REACT_APP_SUCOIN_ADDRESS for Sucoin Contract

They can also be set in the following files:

-  backend_dotnet/Constants/ContractConstants.c
-  frontend_react/src/config.js
